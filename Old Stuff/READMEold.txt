# Welcome to my website!

My name is **Damien Millard**, builder of this website and a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning/Refrigeration Technician.


## About Me

I like electronics, knives, radios, and watches. I am **EPA-608 Universal Certified**, and I am a Technician Amateur Radio Operator, my callsign is [KE8NUF](https://qrz.com/db/ke8nuf).

I also like to make [YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf79sdnAeHB_A1s1_lABkrw) that are fun, sometimes informative, and entertaining, feel free to Subscribe!

I code on GitHub every now and then, I even made a Discord bot (though it is discontinued due to hosting issues). I am learning to use Python and HTML.
My favorite radio bands to operate on are 10 meters and 20 meters (I can only use the 20 meters on [Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day) for right now.)

My current daily carry knives are a [Bear Ops Bear Song VIII Tanto Butterfly Knife](https://www.bladehq.com/item--Bear-Ops-Bear-Song-VIII-Small-Tanto--145127) and a [Spyderco Delica 4](https://www.bladehq.com/item--Spyderco-Delica-4-Knife-Flat-Ground--48918).

Yaesu makes the best quality to price radios I know!

People say that I own too many knives and I am constantly breaking any code I make somehow, but I am having fun in all of it!
